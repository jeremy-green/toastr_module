Toastr Module
=============
A more betta way to handle drupal messages -- I think. It's a module using https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr; hence the name.

Use drush to download the toastr library using the command `drush toastr_library`

Use drush to export toastr settings to a module by using the command `drush fe toastr_settings variable:toastr_settings` (strongarm is required for this.)
